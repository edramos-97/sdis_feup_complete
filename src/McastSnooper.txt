This application was designed to help you debug your backup service: it logs all the messages exchanged via the
multicast channels specified.

To learn how to invoke it, run it without arguments:
    java -jar McastSnooper.jar

java -jar McastSnooper.jar [<logFileName>] <MC_addr>:<MC_port> <MDB_addr>:<MDB_port> <MDR_addr>:<MDR_port>

<logFileName> - Where to store the log file

<MC_addr>:<MC_port>     - Multicast Control Chanel
<MDB_addr>:<MDB_port>   - Multicast Data Chanel
<MDR_addr>:<MDR_port>   - Multicast Recover Chanel
